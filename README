Run MerchantGuideApplication.java inside com.db.app package

You can specify the input file as command line argument else by default the application will pick up Input inside main.com.app.logic package as input file.

Unit Test cases have been written using JUnit.

A sample input file would be like this:

glob is I
prok is V
pish is X
tegj is L
glob glob Silver is 34 Credits
glob prok Gold is 57800 Credits
pish pish Iron is 3910 Credits
how much is pish tegj glob glob ?
how many Credits is glob prok Silver ?
how many Credits is glob prok Gold ?
how many Credits is glob prok Iron ?
how much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck= wood ?

Corresponding output to this would be as given below :

pish tegj glob glob is 42
glob prok Silver is 68 Credits
glob prok Gold is 57800 Credits
glob prok Iron is 782 Credits
I have no idea what you are talking about

The following assumptions are being made:

1) the application is case sensitive i.e. glob is not same as Glob
2) if input passed via arguments then only one argument i.e. args[0] is passed
3) System out logs are used for logging purpose

NOTE: Test cases can further be extended
